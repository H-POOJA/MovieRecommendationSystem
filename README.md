# Building a Movie Recommendation System:
# A Hybrid Approach Using Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering,  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)


A movie recommendation system is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users' film preferences based on their past choices and behaviour.
In this model, we are recommending 5 movies based on the user's past record data.
Use ML to recommend a similar thing that the user liked/searched. Eg. Amazon, Flipkart, Spotify, Youtube, and Netflix

Types of Recommender Systems
1. Collaborative Based Recommenders
2. Content Based Recommender
3. Hybrid (Content+Collaborative)

Approach 1: Content based Recommender system

Dataset: Tmdb dataset from Kaggle

Algorithms performed:-
1. EDA and FE
2. Preprocessing
3. Clustering Model
4. Matrix Factorization
5. Vectorization
6. K-nearest neighbor
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
8. Cosine Similarity
9. Pickle
10. Streamlit for website development.

Approach 2: Collaborative Filtering

Dataset: MovieLens Dataset From Grouplen's Site

Algorithms Performed:
1. EDA
2. Data pre-processing
3. Collaborative filtering using k-Nearest Neighbors
4. Handling the cold-start problem with content-based filtering
5. Dimensionality reduction with matrix factorization
